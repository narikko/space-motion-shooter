# space-motion-shooter
This project aims to develop an intuitive Unity space-shooter game that employs the microcontroller as a motion controller. The microcontroller's onboard accelerometer was utilized to measure motion and estimate tilt angles. These measurements were processed using a Kalman filter to reduce noise and enhance accuracy. Real-time communication with Unity was facilitated via UART, enabling seamless gameplay interactions. Additionally, a pushbutton interrupt allows the player to fire weapons in the game, accompanied by sound effects generated through a DAC speaker.
